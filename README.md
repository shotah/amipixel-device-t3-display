![AmiPixel Avatar Example Image (Placeholder - Replace with an actual image later)](./assets/amipixel_avatar_example.png) ## Overview

AmiPixel is a project to create a charming and interactive digital avatar that lives on the LilyGo T-Display S3 AMOLED Plus. Inspired by classic digital pets like Tamagotchi and playful toys like Cube World, AmiPixel aims to be a delightful device for social connection with friends and family.

**Key Features (Planned - Subject to Development):**

* **Interactive Digital Avatar:** A visually engaging pixel art avatar that responds to user interaction and has its own simple needs and moods.
* **Core Care Actions:** Users can interact with AmiPixel through actions like "Feed," "Play," and "Pet" to care for their avatar.
* **Autonomous Actions:** AmiPixel will have its own set of autonomous actions and behaviors, making it feel alive and responsive even without direct interaction.
* **Basic Needs & Mood System:** A simple system to track AmiPixel's needs (e.g., hunger, boredom) and influence its mood and behavior.
* **Sleep Mode:** AmiPixel will have a sleep mode to conserve power and for nighttime.
* **Expandable Social Features (Future Goal):**  Planned expansion to enable AmiPixels on different devices to interact and connect over Wi-Fi, creating a social network of friendly avatars.
* **Customizable Settings (Future Goal):**  Settings page for device name, brightness, volume (if sound is added), etc.

## Inspirations

* **Cube World (Toy):** [Wikipedia - Cube World (toy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_World_(toy)) -  For its playful and interactive nature, and the idea of miniature worlds.
* **Tamagotchi:** [Wikipedia - Tamagotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi) - For the concept of a digital pet that needs care and attention, and its nostalgic appeal.
* **LilyGo T-Display S3 AMOLED Plus:** [LilyGo Product Page](https://lilygo.cc/products/t-display-s3-amoled?variant=43532279939253) - The hardware platform for AmiPixel, providing a vibrant AMOLED display and Wi-Fi connectivity.
* **LilyGo-AMOLED-Series Examples:** [Device GitHub Repo Examples](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-AMOLED-Series/tree/master/examples) -  Leveraging existing examples and widgets for efficient development.

## Getting Started - Installation

Before you can build and upload AmiPixel, you need to install the PlatformIO Command-Line Interface (CLI).

**Recommended Method:  Using the VS Code PlatformIO IDE Extension**

1. **Install VS Code:** [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. **Install the PlatformIO IDE extension** in VS Code.  Search for "PlatformIO IDE" in the Extensions Marketplace (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X) and install it.  The PlatformIO IDE extension will automatically install the PlatformIO CLI for you.
3. **Restart VS Code** after installing the extension.

**Alternative Method: Manual PlatformIO Core Installation**

If you prefer to install PlatformIO Core manually (without VS Code), follow the official installation guide: [https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html)

**Verify Installation**

After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pio --version
```

**Current Status:**  Project is in early development. Core avatar design and basic interactions are the initial focus.
